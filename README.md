SPARCH-ASSITANT

The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for our batch students to provide their college details. Sprach draws its inspiration from virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows, and Siri for iOS. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands.


Users can interact with the assistant through voice commands. As a personal assistant, Sprach assists the end-user with activities like general human conversation, searching the details of the student. The user commands are analyzed with the help of machine learning to give an optimal solution..


Our project is available to everyone easily. It is named as Sprach Assistant with Voice Recognition Intelligence, which takes the user input in form of voice and process it and returns the output in various forms like action to be performed or the search result is dictated to the end user.
